# HCI Group Project - Group 6

Creating a platformer for the group assignment in CAP3104

# Purpose

Ideate and design a human-computer interaction interface that provides a solution to a problem.

# Directions
1.Think of a problem or application that a human-computer interaction (HCI) interface could solve or improve (e.g., the Plan of Study process is not obvious and is time consuming).

2.Ideate a state-of-the-art HCI interface solution to the problem (e.g., a responsive website for quickly generating and customizing a Plan of Study). 

3.Create a system concept statement that describes the envisioned solution. 

4.Identify 15-25 interactive features required to create the solution. Solutions with fewer than 15 features are likely too simple for this course, and solutions with more than 25 features are likely too complex for this course. Interactive features can be:
   
   Individual pages in a responsive website, desktop application, or mobile application.
    A menu system for navigating individual pages in a responsive website, desktop application, or mobile application.
    Distinct interactive widgets, such as a calendar widget for picking a date or an image widget for cropping photos.
    Distinct interaction techniques, such as navigation controls for a mobile game or a virtual hand technique for a virtual reality application.
    Distinct backend features, such as saving a database record or sending a message to another user.

5.Create storyboards that showcase the design of the solution and incorporates all of the identified interactive features.

6.Create a Gantt chart for progressively developing the solution and interactive features through the following prototypes:
  
  Seed Prototype: Develop a local prototype of your human-computer interaction interface.
    Root Prototype: Develop a horizontal or vertical prototype of your human-computer interaction interface.
    Trunk Prototype: Develop a T prototype of your human-computer interaction interface.
    Branch Prototype: Develop a complete prototype of your human-computer interaction interface.
    Crown Prototype: Iterate upon the complete prototype of your human-computer interaction interface.

7.Assign tasks to each team member for each prototype based on their skills, expertise, and/or interests.

8.Create a PDF document that includes:
    The system concept statement.
    The storyboards showcasing all 15-25 interactive features.
    A Gantt chart that clearly indicates which interactive features will be developed for each prototype and which team members will be responsible for the development       of each feature.

9.Submit the PDF document.
